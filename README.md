# CS_330

I have learned many new skills while working on this project. One of the most important skills I took away is the ability to move 3D object around in a 3D scene. There are many jobs that require you to have knowledge of 3D scenes, so this is 
something very useful for me. The design process I followed was to first ensure I could get everything working at a basic level, and then start adding new things. I was able to change the shapes, add textures, add a camera, and add lighting. I 
was able to do all of this one at a time to ensure everything would work together. I believe building things in small sections is a great practice for any programming project. 

As stated above, I was able to build my project in small steps. This strategy allowed me to complete my project on time and with a high quality. I had to iterate many times through this project. It was a lot of changing numbers to see exactly
how it changed the scene. This allowed me to fine tune nearly every aspect of my project and gave me confidence in my work.

I believe this course was a great way to learn problem solving. It was incredibly challenging, but rewarding to see my scene come to life. I believe that this new knowledge will not only help me in my education, but as a software developer in
the future.
